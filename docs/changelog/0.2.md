# Changelog 0.2.*
{: .no_toc }



If any version is skipped, it indicates that nothing changed in that version, and the version bump was due to CI running more than once, or a change to code base that does not affect MetaBuild itself.






## [0.2.99](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/851)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-709

When you do
```
[projectA]inherit_from=projectB
```
in your lock file, you should also have a `project_link(projectB)` in your spec files. And potentially tell MB how to find projectB in your lock file as well (inherit_from can be used recursively). This was not indicated clearly in the messages that MetaBuild printed, especially if MetaBuild failed due to missing `project_link(projectB)`. The messages are now improved.



## [0.2.98](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/845)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-817

This PR extends ccache coverage to almost all combinations of generators and platforms. See the updated status below.
See example of using ccache at [the MetaBuild ccache unit test](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/tree/0.2.94/tests/generator/__fixtures__/ccache_test_app). More documentation to come.

Note that to be able to get hits when building with CMake from different source directories (e.g. Jenkins), you should follow the [ccache instructions](https://ccache.dev/manual/4.6.1.html#_compiling_in_different_directories) as well as setting the `cmake.base_dir` config.

| win32 | win32 | msvs | yes | 
| win32 | uwp | msvs | yes |
| win32 | android | CMake | yes (this PR) |

## [0.2.96](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/849)

Fix MetaBuild Xcode Ccache wrapper script generation so multiple major versions of Xcode are supported by the same generated projects. Instead of hardcoding the active toolchain into the Ccache wrapper scripts during `metabuild prepare`, now the active toolchain is looked up at build time.

Previously, using different major versions of Xcode with Ccache enabled could lead to surprising build errors in the macOS SDK. For example, if Xcode 12.x is used at prepare time and Xcode 13.x is used at build time, you might get the following build error:

```
/Applications/Xcode_13.2/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX12.1.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSBundle.h:91:143: error: function does not return NSString
```



## [0.2.95](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/848)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-713

MSVS used to fail when `.rc` files were present in a target which also defined preprocessor marcros in the form `key="VALUE WITH SPACE"`. This issue is fixed now.



## [0.2.94](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/847)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-844

Expose xcode's enable_bitcode as a MetaBuild option (`meta//:xcode_enable_bitcode`). This way projects can query if this flag is enabled or not and adjust their behaviour if needed. See example [usage](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-specs/boringssl/pull/27).



## [0.2.93](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/846)

Fix the `metabuild config locations` command was printing invalid entries (recent regression). This PR fixes that.


## [0.2.90](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/841)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-821

1. MetaBuild now properly defines the `__EMSCRIPTEN__` macro by default when building for wasm. If you had to put it in your `universe_flags` in the past, you can now remove it.
2. The wasm platform, unlike linux, android, or macos, needs global activation of pthreads. Before this versions users had to use universe_flags to acheive it (by placing `-pthread` in both `exported_linker_flags` and `exported_compiler_flags` like [here](https://git.corp.adobe.com/photoshop/virtual_memory/blob/v0.0.4/META/META.py#L21-L27)). Now MetaBuild allows you to control this behavior via the option `emsdk.enable_pthreads`. You can now place 
    ```
    [emsdk]
    enable_pthreads=true
    ```
    in your lock file to activate pthreads for wasm. There is no need to use universe_flags anymore. In addition to convenience, this has the advantange that `meta.py` files can now query if pthreads is active or not by looking at the value of this option (`meta//:emsdk_enable_pthreads`). 



## [0.2.89](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/842)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-836

Before this PR, if you passed `sha256=''` to `http_file()` or `http_archive()` it manifested itself with a strange behavior. The sha of the downloaded file were not locked in META.lock, but some other side-effects started manifesting. This resulted in some users abusing it (Hello Hyrum's law. Obligatory [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1172/) comic) and then running into other issues. This PR fixes that. If you pass `''` it means you expect a file with sha256 equal to empty string.


## [0.2.87](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/838)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-833

Support creating broken symlinks in `genrule`s. This can be used for shared library versioning without needing to override `out` of the `genrule` to match the target `CxxNode`.



## [0.2.86](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/837)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-817

- Add default download links for ccache `version=4.6.1`.
- Extended the unit tests of ccache to actually check for hits when building from different directories.



## [0.2.85](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/835)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-494

When users use tags to checkout git repos instead of sha, MetaBuild utilities its cache much better now even if the `--cached` parameter is not passed. Previously MetaBuild made unnecessary git calls in this scenario. Also added unit tests.

Note that still if you pass anything other than full `sha` values to the `commit=` property of a `git_checkout` or `project_link` MetaBuild will lock the sha value. If you wish to pass a tag to `commit=`, you can ask MetaBuild to not automatically lock and take the responsibility yourself by passing `auto_lock=False`. When disabling auto-lock it is your responsibility to ensure that you are passing enough reproducible info to MetaBuild so the lock still produces the same result in future (e.g. don't pass branches).



## [0.2.84](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/836)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-823

MetaBuild will not set `ENABLE_TESTABILITY` to true by default. Xcode's default value will take over.
The problem with `ENABLE_TESTABILITY` is that it will override `GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN` and `GCC_INLINES_ARE_PRIVATE_EXTERN`. Users can  fine tune this still via `universe_flags`.



## [0.2.83](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/834)

Make sure MetaBuild's version and python version are captured in log files



## [0.2.82](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/832)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-699
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-682

This situation will now work properly
```py
cxx_library(
    name = "my_bundle",
    xcode_product_type = "bundle",
    xcode_resources = "something.json",
)
```
Before this fix, there was a bug and this target was skipped. The workaround was to add `srcs="dummy.cpp"` to the `cxx_library()` node.



## [0.2.81](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/831)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-791

If  one or more `config` values is supplied for an `option()` node, at least one of them must have the name of the project as prefix, e.g.
```py
set_project_name("Fusion")
option(
    name = "some_option,
    config = [
        "Fusion.some_option_config",
         # you can add more aliases here too, but it is important to have
         # one config that starts with project name, e.g. if you want a case insensitive
         # alias: "fusion.some_option_config" so from command line you can also suppy
         # --define fusion.some_option_config=...
    ]
)
```
This will allow the users to set the value of this option via the config file
```
[Fusion]
some_option_config = value
```

If such a config is not provided, MetaBuild will issue a warning.


## [0.2.80](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/830)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-466

Add a unit test that the `--cached` parameter to MetaBuild works properly. If you are using MetaBuild and you don't have an internet connection, you should use this parameter when running MetaBuild. If all the data you want is already in the cache, metabuild prepare will succeed. The main change that this parameter activates is that MetaBuild will trust branches and tags inside its cache. Without this parameter, MetaBuild always checks with the remote repos if these refs are updated.

Usage of --cached was broken, but was fixed in version 0.2.75 (PR 828).

## 0.2.78 [PR1](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/826), [PR2](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/827)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-772

MetaBuild has the parameter `msvs_generates_import_library` to `cxx_library` to tell MetaBuild that a shared win32 library (dll) does not produce a .lib file. However, even when this was set to False, the project that MetaBuild generated still tried to link to the `.lib` file generated by the library which did not exist and caused failures. This PR fixes this case. Now this dll is only copied to the executable binary but no linking is performed (since there is no .lib file).

This workflow was requested by 3DI since it is used by the [Pixar USD library](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/index.html) for their plugins. Such dlls are used only in a limited set of situations since it is not really possible to access the functions inside them, since they are not exported. USD has some machinery to access the functions out of the dll. Another usecase, are legacy windows resources that are compiled into a dll.

This fix is only added and tested on win32. We don't have any users for this workflow in `uwp` so holding off making any change in this regard there.


## 0.2.75 [PR1](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/823), [PR2](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/828)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-758

MetaBuild auto-locking mechanism is META.lock is now stricter. In the past you could put something like this in configs (assume Lagrange is registered in meta-libs)
```
[lagrange]
commit = <sha>
```
and MetaBuild would have changed it to
```
[lagrange]
commit = <sha>
version = <latest version>
```
This had a shortcoming. Package manager promises that same version produces the same code throughout history. But it does not promise the repo that it fetches has all the same commits. So instead now we do a more strict locking
```
[lagrange]
repo = <repo>
commit = <sha>
submodules = <submodules>
version = <latest version>
```
(we still lock the version too so the user knows the info came from overriding that version).


## [0.2.73](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/822)

- The `meta_build` executable is now removed. The only valid executable for MetaBuild is `metabuild`.
- Unused dependency `openstep_parser` is removed.


## 0.2.72 [PR1](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/820), [PR2](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/821)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-710

If a repo had tags that showed up with postfix `^{}` in the `git ls-remote` command, MetaBuild got confused when those tags where used to refer to the repo via the `[project_name]version=...` syntax. MetaBuild failed to use its cache and always added an extra `commit=` to the lock file after running. This PR will fix that.


## [0.2.70](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/819)

If artifactory API key is missing we no longer ask for it in a prompt. And exception will be raised with an informative message. This also allowed remove dependency on PromptToolkit.


## [0.2.67](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/813)

Update Default CMake version to handle spaces in dylib names.



## [0.2.66](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/799)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-650

Enhance ability to exclude certain deps. This is helpful for not inherriting certain default flags from MetaBuild builtin project.
Example
```python
cxx_binary(
  name = "myexec",
  # prevents inheritting the exported_compiler_flags = ["/utf-8"] in this node
  # from the default flags.
  excluded_deps = ["meta//:msvs_utf8_flags"],
)
```



## [0.2.65](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/811)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-796

Fix corner cases where the thread that drew the live status table and the MetaBuild thread stepped on each other's toes and resulted in an error like
```
Top promise in the stack doesn't match on this Worker `main`
```


## 0.2.64 [PR1](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/810), [PR2](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/812)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-805
  - Sets DisableBuildSystemDeprecationDiagnostic to True in workspace settings if legacy build is enabled. This would allow using the legacy build even for Xcode 13 (for intel compiler). Other than for using intel compiler, legacy build system must be avoided.
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-807
  - Fix regression introduced in `0.2.61` discovered by `meta-specs/v8`. 



## 0.2.63 [PR1](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/808), [PR2](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/809)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-730
- Fix bool parameters and add support for newer versions for `ccache`. E.g., this should work now:
  ```python
  [ccache]
  hash_dir=false
  version = 4.6.0
  ```
- Allow setting path to ccache as string. This helps doing ccache.bin_command=ccache if ccache is already on your path. This is to help CI builders that have ccache installed via their package managers.


## [0.2.62](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/808)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-730
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-793

Ccache: Fix bool params and add support for newer versions. E.g., this should work now.
```
[ccache]
hash_dir=false
version = 4.6.0
```



## [0.2.61](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/787)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-663

Allow using config dependent TPL in user_lib() function, e.g.
  ```python
  user_lib(
      dll = "$(config.type)/$(config.arch)/tbb.dll",
      lib = "$(location :genrule)/tbb.lib",
  )
  ```

## [0.2.60](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/804)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-802

LazyPath.rmtree() now handles symlinks as well (including broken ones).


## [0.2.59](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/803)
Changes related to MP integration (DVA)

## 0.2.58 [PR1](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/802) - [PR2](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/805)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-798

Android invoker (for unit tests) had an issue where executable would become stable and running a new executable subsequently ran the old one. This should fix that.

## [0.2.57](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/800)
Internal changes, update the linters in MetaBuild codebase.

## [0.2.56](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/798)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-794

Added an option to control xcode's "GCC_INLINES_ARE_PRIVATE_EXTERN" and set the default value to false. This should get rid of errors like (happen on some xcode versions which set the default value to true for executables):
```
ld: warning: direct access in function 'Catch::isDebuggerActive()' from file '/Users/hoshyari/code_adobe/meta/MshIO/dist/xcode_macos/Debug/universal/temp/mshio/mshio_tests/mshio_tests.build/Objects-normal/arm64/test_main.o' to global weak symbol 'std::__1::basic_ostream<char, std::__1::char_traits<char> >& std::__1::endl<char, std::__1::char_traits<char> >(std::__1::basic_ostream<char, std::__1::char_traits<char> >&)' from file '/Users/hoshyari/code_adobe/meta/MshIO/dist/xcode_macos/Debug/universal/build/mshio/mshio/mshio.a(load_msh.o)' means the weak symbol cannot be overridden at runtime. This was likely caused by different translation units being compiled with different visibility settings.
```

## [0.2.52](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/790)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-788

- Update brew commit and allow it to install specific version of package. So we can install specific go in the unit test. The new go seems to be broken.
- Moved all brew and emsdk specific configs to the default_config.yaml file for transparency.
- Update EMSDK default version to 3.1.0 (which also works on M1 macbooks).



## [0.2.51](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/788)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-752

Some workarounds for host specific issues related to UWP tests.


## [0.2.50](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/785)

Allow `metabuild test` to run binaries that have shared lib deps in android. Previously we failed not finding the shared libs.

## [0.2.49](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/786)

Fix problem with options that have value of None. 
```python
copy_artifacts(out = "$(option //options:value)") 
```
should now work even if option has value of None.


## [0.2.48](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/784)

1. We were always appending the nodejs npmrc, even if it was not the first time we downloaded it. So this was just polluting that file. 
2. Explicitly address xattr with /usr/bin/xattr for android sdk, this way if there is a xattr installed by brew in `/usr/bin/local` it won't be picked up by accident. This should fix installation of android sdk.


## [0.2.47](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/781)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-759
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-781

1. `metabuild build -a universal` now works.
2. Updated default cmake version to 3.20.0. Previous 3.17.0 had issues enforcing order of genrules.
3. Internal change: re-enable some unit tests that needed prebuilt artifacts. The prebuilts are now generated on demand instead of using artifactory.


## 0.2.46 [PR4](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/780), [PR3](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/778), [PR2](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/777), [PR1](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/776)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-768


1. Remove the apple_silicon option entirely.  If a non-universal binary is desired, use active_arch. Current behaviour for macos and xcode is
    ```
    Default -> Generates a project that will build a universal binary
    --define mb.active_arch_macos=X -> Generates a project that will build a binary for arch X only (X can be arm64 or x64)
    ```
    The old behaviour used to be
    ```
    Default -> Generates a project that will build a universal binary on M1 host, and a x64 project on x64 host.
    --define mb.apple_silicon=true -> Generates a project that will build a universal binary
    --define mb.active_arch_macos=X -> Generates a project that will build a binary for arch X only (X can be arm64 or x64)
    ```
    Also, the filters `target.feature_flag("universal")` and `target.feature_flag("apple_silicon")` that could be used to query if a universal project is being built are now deprecated. Use the existing `target.xcode & ~target.feature_flag("active_arch_is_set")` instead. When active arch is not set, project is universal on `xcode`.

2. CMake can now also build for arm64 macos. Please keep in mind that cmake support for macos is experimental and there will be no user support for it.
3. Fixed some issues related to `only_cpu_arch` sharing of genrules, if they were used with phase = "build".


## [0.2.44](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/775)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-771

Fix handling tarfiles with hardlinks in them.

## [0.2.43](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/773)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-526

Default value for `xcode.only_active_arch_debug` used to be true before this PR. This made some confusion for the users where they built only for host arch in debug and universal binary for Release (for macos and iphonesimulator). We now make it consistent to avoid confusion. Users that wish to build only for host arch for fast iterations can set the value of `xcode.only_active_arch_debug=true` either in their META.lock, or META.user.yaml files.



## [0.2.42](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/772)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-673

Fixed the workflow and added a test for depending on frameworks and dylibs per architecture in xcode universal builds. Note that we don't support simultaneouly copying them to app bundle and linking against them due to xcode limitations. Another issue is that if you do not use a `resource_map` or `target.exclude_from_copy` to not copy these files, MetaBuild will not error out, it will just write an xcode project that always includes these files and you will get errors when trying to build that "The framework xxx does not contain all the needed architectures". These remaining issues are tracked by [METAB-766](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-766). It is recommended for per-arch dylib and frameworks to merge them via a genrule so that xcode can depend on the merged version and no arch filter is needed.



## [0.2.41](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/767)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-520
  - Fix for METAB-520, a race condition that could manifest in some use cases of async functions


## [0.2.40](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/764)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-633
  - Fixed the test bundle used in remote tests to include shared libraries.
  - Fixed building target that uses `user_lib` with a framework  on cmake.
  - Fix the @rpath for linux and macos targets on cmake. It is not hardcoded to use the original dlls and points to executable directory.


## [0.2.39](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/770)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-754
  - Work-around a bug in target filtering causing `metabuild prepare` to fail for projects with Ccache enabled and a `copy_artifacts`/`archive_artifacts`.
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-756
  - Fix copy_artifacts() for the tool xcode product type.

## [0.2.38](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/768)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-753

Fix changelog generation script.


## [0.2.37](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/763)
- Part 1 for https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-520

There should be no change to MetaBuild's behaviour. This version just added some type hints and comments.


## [0.2.36](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/766)

Adds new `xcode.last_upgrade_version` setting to control Xcode's LastUpgradeCheck (pbxproj) and LastUpgradeVersion (xcscheme) settings that control the "Upgrade to recommended settings" project file warnings



## [0.2.35](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/765)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-749

If you had two files in the same target with the same name in case insensitive manner, but the names are different in case sensitive manner (e.g. main.cpp and MAN.cpp) the object files overwrite each other and we got linker errors. This will fix that.

## [0.2.34](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/762)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-739
- Now you can ask glob (when exclude_directories is off) to not include the parent directory via the parameter `include_root=False`. 
- If the same `glob()` object is evaluated is used in multiple places, it will now be evaluated only once.
- __Breaking change__ Now you cannot access the result of `glob()` without using `await ctx.eval_list_async()`. An exception will be raised if you try that. We expect the bad practice of accessing the result of glob operation to be small among the existing projects.
- __Breaking change__ `glob()` now expects the pattern to be passed as the first argument. This is to reduce confusion and accidental globbing of unneeded files. Previous behaviour was to default to `./**` if not pattern was specified. We expect the bad practice of not specifying the pattern to be small among the existing projects.

Improve how Xcode configuration variable inheritance is implemented. This will allow each Xcode target to inherit only the Xcode configuration variables that it needs. Since Xcode exports all the variables as env vars before running pre-link and post-build scripts, too many of them can cause bash to reach max env size and prevent the scripts to run. This change will help with this problem.

## [0.2.31](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/760)

Add msvs_flag '[RunSettingsFilePath](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/configure-unit-tests-by-using-a-dot-runsettings-file)', useful for working around a Test Explorer [performance issue](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/1688680).

## [0.2.30](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/750)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-636

Added a `timeout ` parameter to `context.invoke` in the test invoker, and `context.execute/context.shell` in the genrule. This is used to specify the number of seconds the invoked binary is allowed to run. If the process does not terminate after `timeout` seconds a `MetaShellException` is raised.

Fix for Changelog update script (git log command was not working. Probably due to not having all the tags fetched).


## [0.2.26](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/753)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-717

Include zip format archives for NodeJS, NuGet, and VSWhere so they can be downloaded from Artifactory.

## [0.2.24](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/736)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-714

Update the changelog based on commit information since the last update.


## [0.2.22](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/747)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-683

MetaBuild `test()` nodes are not meant to ran in order. Each node is an isolated test that should be able to run on its own. Therefore, if a test throws, we don't bubble up the exception anymore. Instead, MetaBuild will keep running and just report that test as failed. The exception and its stack trace will be recorded in MetaBuild agglomerated test report file.

## [0.2.21](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/713)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-703

Loosen constraints for PyYAML so conflicts can be resolved more easily.
Stager ran into a conflict with another dependency which resulted in a hang during conda's pip install step. We still kept the min version 5.3.1 and did not change the packages uploaded to artifactory. Because the new pyyarml (6.0) seems to have issues with our packaging pipeline.

## [0.2.19](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/724)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-648

Support for weak linking. See the [documentation on Dynamic Loaded Libraries]({{ "/docs/guides/general/dlls" | relative_url }}).

## [0.2.18](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/737)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-629

- Now `cmake.path` and `ninja.path` accept path to bundles as well as executables. If path to bundle or executable is wrong we will now raise a proper message.
- Removed some misleading behaviour
  - Passing `<tool>.path=...` would have installed cmake at that path if it was missing! We are not supposed to do that. But instead we should just raise an error that the path is wrong. MB only installs tools in its cache.
  - Removed the `nodejs.path` config. Unlike cmake and nodejs and other tools, MB can handle many versions of ninja in the same universe via the `nodejs()` node. This node must have a `version =` input. So unlike cmake where you can pass `cmake.path`, to tell MB to use `this` cmake, with nodejs this is not valid. You have to say which version the path is for. In previous version instead of this behaviour we were using that nodejs for all versions.
- Removed `tool.use_public_binaries_<version>`. Opt for simpler behaviour. If `.use_public_binaries` we use the public links, if not the local ones. If user wants to override we already have `<tool>.url_<version>`.
- There is no separate `metabuild <tool> install` and `metabuild <tool> download` commands. Merged them.
- Other than `nodejs` all the other `metabuild <tool> ...` commands can now run without specifying a version. They read it from he configs.
- Added many comments and default configs to default_configs.yaml

## [0.2.17](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/742)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-521

This PR adds a new MSVS flag to disable user-wide integration for this [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/integration/). This will avoid conflicts where there are existing dependencies handled by vcpkg which can conflicts with dependencies handled by MetaBuild when using Visual Studio solution.

## [0.2.16](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/740)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-667

Fix `gtest` output parser. It was not handling skipped tests correctly before.

## [0.2.14](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/738)

Allow metabuild to accept functools.partial for the lazy functions. Now we can do:
```py
import functools

genrule(
py = functools.partial(function, param1 = ...)
)
```

## [0.2.12](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/734)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-715

Console will always print as unicode. This should allow MetaBuild to work even if python's default encoding is not `utf-8`.

- Related [slack](https://adobe-torq.slack.com/archives/CP416U06M/p1645181923010109) discussion. 

On [0.1.371](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/commit/8ea0813441e2811834d423030bb285695e4f68b2) we started settings `xcode.code_sign_allowed` to `true` including for all targets (including static libs). This broke some workflows. This PR fixes it. The default value is None which let's xcode's default value to kick in.

## [0.2.9](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/731)

Allow filtering msvs based on installation path as well as other configs. Photoshop CI has multiple msvs with similar versions installed and this should help disambiguate them.

## [0.2.5](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/721)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-698

The yaml configs now don't allow passing floats as string due to their lossiness. Example:
```
# yaml file:
hello: 1.20
# Parsed value: float 1.2
# Parsed value converted to string: '1.2'
```

## [0.2.3](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/721)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-451

Better handling of configs like `msvs.version` configs that are strings when they are specified in the yaml config files.

## [0.2.2](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/720)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-662

Allow using all lower case paths to project locations on windows for the `[project_name]local_link` config. E.g.,
  ```
  [reflect]
  local_link = c:/code-adobe/reflect
  ```

## [0.2.0](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/711)
https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-690

- When MB is installed from a dev branch, include the branch name and sha in the version. This way if we try to install MB now from a different branch the install will go through. Whereas, in the past where everything was 0.1, pip thought version is the same and nothing happened.
- Allow uploading PR branches to artifactory too. Helpful for debugging for teams who are transitioning to MB.
- The version format for dev branch is `major.minor.dev0+branch_name.git_sha`
