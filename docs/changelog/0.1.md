# Changelog 0.1.*
{: .no_toc }



If any version is skipped, it indicates that nothing changed in that version, and the version bump was due to CI running more than once, or a change to code base that does not affect MetaBuild itself.


## [0.1.629](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/702)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-660

This is now a valid and correct usage of `user_lib` when you want to link against a shared lib.
  ```python
  linker_libraries = [
      user_lib(dll = "somelib.dylib"),
  ],
  ```
Scenarious where both `dll=` and `lib=` are specified and the `dll=` is already a linkable object will now throw.

#### Note
If you use `user_lib(somelib.dylib)` or its equivalent `user_lib(lib = somelib.dylib)` instead of `dll=` MetaBuild will not copy the library into the executable location (for backward compatiblity we still do it for xcode but it is planned to be removed). If you are using `user_lib` for shared lib on macos or linux, make sure to use the `dll` argument.

## [0.1.628](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/716)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-675

MetaBuild used to try to setup the Xcode project in way that some products like `bundle`s or `metal libraries` where being linked against. This products are not meant to be linked against. They are just meant to be copied to executable directory. This PR should fix that.

## 0.1.627 [PR1](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/710), [PR2](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/703), [PR3](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/715)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-676
  - Better handling of MetaBuild checkout out worktrees within `dist/` folder.
- Add an `--open-project` argument to prepare. This will open the generated project after prepare is finished.
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-681
  - Fix `copy_artifacts()` failing in some corner cases where multiple executables (or shared libraries) dependended on a common same shared library.

## [0.1.626]()
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-674

Fixes for building for `wasm` on windows.

## [0.1.623](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/707)

DVA (MetaProjects) related change.

## [0.1.621](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/704)

Print clickable link to project file after prepare is done, following this [slack thread](https://adobe.slack.com/archives/CP416U06M/p1643301816264200?thread_ts=1643257051.257600&cid=CP416U06M)

## [0.1.620](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/701)

DVA (MetaProject) related change. Use JSON to communicate between MP and MetaBuild instead of Pickle.

## [0.1.617](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/680)

- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-480
  - Added a filter `(target.trim_destination("prefix"), "value")`. This will match any value going to a folder starting with prefix, remove the prefix and add the  new value as the prefix. This allows saying MB please redirection everything that was supposed to go to `frameworks` for example to another location.
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-614
  - If you had a file going to {"resources/subdir" : "file"}, then in resource_map you said ((..., "newfolder")), then the file went into the folder `newfolder/resources/subdir`, whereas you would expect it to go to `newfolder/subdir`. That `resources` is the destination and not part of the subpath.
- Part of https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-440
  - Lazy functions that are passed to resource map for `copy_artifacts` will now understand the `$(file.type)` tpl in ctx.eval(). 
  - resource_map of cxx_binary still will not so ticket is not fully complete. This one is more complicated.
  - Other fixes found trying to finally integrate copy_artifacts in stager in light of fixes and remove work arounds https://git.corp.adobe.com/euclid/stager/pull/1416
  - Copy symlinks as symlinks (to not mess up mac frameworks)

  

## [0.1.616](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-641)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-641

Support for Apple's AppClips

## [0.1.615](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/696)

DVA (MetaProject) changes related to handling different MP modules with the same name.


## [0.1.613](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/691)

DVA (MetaProject) changes related to reading MSVS properties.

## [0.1.609](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/677)

User experience imprevements when using MetaBuild in git bash (or any console that does not have tty)
  - Detect if we are on git bash and if tty is available, then print a warning about winpty.
  - Add some info logs if tty is disabled, so user sees what is happening even if tty is off. On Jenkins, this might now result in more prints (since Jenkins does not have tty either). To get rid of them pass the `--no-live-status` parameter to MetaBuild.


## [0.1.603](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/672)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-593

Remove the deprecated `importer` functionality from MetaBuild. This was a semi-automatic way to get a MetaBuild spec out of raw Xcode projects.

## [0.1.600](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/669)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-643

Fixes for CMake on windows related to `genrule()`s. This should now allow building for Android and Wasm on windows as well as linux and macos.

## [0.1.599](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/667)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-552

Fix an issue with `resource_map` on windows which cause special locations (e.g. `executables`, `frameworks`) to not work.

## [0.1.598](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/666)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-414

Xcode won't add a `lib` prefix to targets by default anymore. If you wish to prepend a `lib` to the target's name, explicitly do that via `product_name =`.

## [0.1.594](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/662)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-631

Added an optional timeout parameter to all git commands. This can be set via the `git.timeout` config. It would allow more graceful failure for situations like this [slack thread](https://adobe.slack.com/archives/CP416U06M/p1639590000471500).

## 0.1.593 [PR1](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/660), [PR2](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/664)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-632
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-365

Fixes related to `copy_artifacts()`.
    - `target.label()` was ignored in some cases in the `resource_map=`. This should be fixed now.
    - If you had a binary (except macos bundled apps) or a shared lib that depended on another shared lib, `copy_artifacts` did not copy the dependency shared lib automatically. So the binary could not run, or the shared lib could not be used. This issue is fixed now.
    - It also fixes `.lib` or `.a` files getting classified as `dylib` if they were inserted in `linker_libraries` without using `user_lib(dll = )`.

## [0.1.582](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/659)

Loosen version contraints on the psutil dependency. This should allow MetaBuild to co-exist with other packages in users' CI system.

## [0.1.579](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/616)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-534
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-547
- Support the extra configurations of CMake. You can now call `metabuild build` with `--config RelWithDebInfo` or `--config MinSizeRel` when the generator is cmake.

## [0.1.577](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/652), [0.1.578](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/656)

## [0.1.562](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/638)
- `metabuild version` was broken after `0.1.558`. This version fixes that.

## [0.1.558](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/633)
- Make stricter checks for command line arguments. Certain invalid arguments passed to MetaBuild were ignored (for example passing `--config` during prepare time). After this version, MetaBuild is going to refuse such arguments.

## [0.1.557](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-568)
- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/METAB-568
- In case of a failure, MetaBuild will now point the user to the log file instead of printing a general message about using log files.

## [0.1.556](https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/pull/634)
- A fix for the test API. Now by default the unit tests introduced by dependencies are not included in the MetaBuild test phase. To include them use the MetaBuild, `test.include_dependency_tests = true` configs. See the [test API docs]({{ "/docs/api/nodes/test#tests-filtering" | relative_url }})
