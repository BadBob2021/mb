	## Overview

	In MetaBuild, "configurations" are a means for users to interact with MetaBuild. Each configuration has a form: `<prefix>.<name>` 

	For example:

	Configuration | Prefix | Name
	|----------|----------|----------
	|`xcode.valid_archs`|xcode|valid_archs
	|`projA//deps:googletest_git.commit`|projA//deps:googletest_git|commit

	## Configuring the behavior of the core of MetaBuild

	Some configurations configure the behavior of the core of MetaBuild.
	* We try to list all these configs under the `default_config.yaml` file within MetaBuild: https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/blob/main/metabuild/config/default_config.yaml (if any is missing, please inform us: ***Link to creating a JIRA ticket and #metabuild***)
	* Some of these configs are associated with the `option()` nodes within the MetaBuild builtin project:
	- builtin project: https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/tree/0.2.92/metabuild/builtin
	- Examples `option()` node; the associated config is the value passed to the config= field: https://git.corp.adobe.com/meta-build/meta-build/blob/0.2.92/metabuild/builtin/cmake.meta.py#L40-L55
	* Other configurations control behavior of user's code (***will get back to this -- tbd***).

	## Setting the value of these configs

	See this link: https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/meta-build/docs/guides/config_files/

	There are two ways to set the value of these configs.

	**Method 1 : Edit the config files** 
	* You can open the config files and change the values.
	- Each file has a different format: https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/meta-build/docs/guides/config_files/#metalock-file. In each format, see how `<prefix>` and `<name>` should be specified.

	* Or you can use the `metabuild config` command line executable: https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/meta-build/docs/cli/metabuild_config/
	- This is an interface to acheive the same goal as editing the file.

	**Method 2 : Override value of configs**
	* As an alternative to the method above, during MetaBuild prepare you can override value of the configs. This is via the `â€“define <prefix>.<name>=<value>` argument https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/meta-build/docs/cli/metabuild_config/#command-line-args: (this entry is in this file by mistake, it should be moved to https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/meta-build/docs/guides/config_files/)
	* Notes: 
	- Note about `inherit_from`: You can use `<project_name>.inherit_from=other_project_name`. This will cause MetaBuild to read the config file of the other_project and set configs with `prefix=<project_name>` from the lock file of that project. When doing this you have ot make sure that you have a `project_link()` to other_project as well.
	- Note about platform suffix: If you set `<prefix>.<name>_<platform>=value` in a config file, it only sets it for that <platform>. (I think this is missing from the docs).

	## Changing the behavior of MetaBuild nodes via configs

	It was mentioned above that an option can be used to modify the behavior of user's code too. Let's see how it is done.

	* Some of metabuild's nodes (like `git_checkout()`) can be modfied via configurations. If the target reference (https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/meta-build/docs/guides/target_refs/) of the `git_checkout` node is `my_proj//deps:my_repo`, the following configs mentioned here (https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/meta-build/docs/api/git_checkout/) can be used to override the repo or commit of the git_checkout node.
	- Similarly for `option()` nodes, you can use `target_ref.value`.
	- In addition `option()` node also has a `config= entry`. This allows setting the value of the option with configs other than target_ref.value. See this [link](https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/meta-build/docs/api/option/#config). It is always recommended that options have one config with prefix equal to the name of the project they belong to. This will make the config files much more readable.
	* When MetaBuild loads dependency projects with `project_link()`, the means by which that project can be loaded can be configured via configs: https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/meta-build/docs/api/project_link/#tldr
